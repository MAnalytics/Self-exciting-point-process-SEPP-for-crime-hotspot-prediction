# Self-exciting-point-process-SEPP-for-crime-hotspot-prediction
Given a historical record of crime, this script models the hotspot surface (a representation of the vulnerable locations to imminent victimisations) 
Required data sets include:
1. A regular spatial grid system covering the area of study (required CRS: WGS84)
2. Historical records of crime with time (t) and location (lat,long) information
